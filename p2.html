                        I still want to believe that there is magic in this world. That we are all capable of magic in our own ways. But then when that magic turns into manic, people pull tricks I never knew they had and yours was the greatest trick of all time. It almost got me fooled- I understood what you had done so quickly but my heart took longer to process; much longer, I admit, and eventually I sought help. I know I would still be under your spell if the people I didn’t trust pulled me out.

                        Humans will be humans until there is a problem that they realize is much more complicated than the human brain can solve. My elementary school teachers taught me not to take candy from strangers but they didn’t teach me how to put my heart away and let my brain deal with a problem;  I’ve learned that you win some and then you lose a lot more until you start winning again. It’s all part of the magic in this world.

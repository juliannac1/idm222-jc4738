                    Moon Girl
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Her true self emerges under the glow of the moon 
                    <br>
                    The subtle gleam of lunar beauty 
                    <br>
                    She is not worthy enough for the sun 
                    <br>
                    So she seeks comfort in the dead of night
                    <br>
                    As she reaches for the stars,
                    <br>
                    Her footsteps dance in sync with the wind 
                    <br>
                    Her spirit
                    <br>
                    Her grace
                    <br>
                    Her pained and aggrieved soul
                    <br>
                    She whispers secrets to the daisies as they fall asleep
                    <br>
                    All she ever wanted was to be heard
                    <br>
                    The moon holds her hand when she’s lost
                    <br>
                    And for a moment
                    <br>
                    This young girl is <em>holding the sky</em>
                    <br>
                    Together,
                    <br>
                    They are one
                    <br>
                    Together,
                    <br>
                    They are beautiful 
                    <br>
                    She is the moon’s girl

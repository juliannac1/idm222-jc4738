                <em>i could never seem to replace the people who have left my life with new ones.</em>
                <br>
                new people, I mean.
                <br>
                it didn’t matter how much time I spend with them or
                <br>
                how much love and admiration I have for them
                <br>
                these new people only fill a section of me that has never been explored before
                <br>
                a section I have never felt in my body before 
                <br>
                its an unfamiliar feeling, yes.
                <br>
                as for the people who have left me?
                <br>
                or those I had to leave?
                <br>
                they’ve clasped onto my life and 
                <br>
                they exist in every hole inside of me
                <br>
                perhaps, they’re more like rips,
                <br>
                like a piece of fabric
                <br>
                but I see them in every piece of song lyric I hear or 
                <br>
                the most random things I see
                <br>
                the more someone leaves,
                <br>
                the more susceptible I am to topple
                <br>
                and bottle a gallon of bleach
                <br>
                but in return of such circumstance
                <br> 
                i am able to learn a different way of hanging on
                <br>
                to make sure that I do not lose my balance 
                <br>
                and end up standing in front of a loaded gun. 
                <br>
                i am a piece of rope and I’ve just attached myself to a snapped tree branch 
                <br>
                its time to untie myself now
                <br>
                and run.
                <br>
                run far far away
                <br>
                i am a piece of fabric 
                <br>
                that is edging for its collapse
                <br>
                simply touching it can cause a commotion
                <br>
                now I’m not a monster,
                <br>
                i will visit these holes every now and then to pay my respects but 
                <br>
                that’s all.
                <br>
                for it is not safe to poke this hole now
                <br>
                it is not safe to try to hang from a snapping tree branch.

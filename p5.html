                Moon Girl
            </h1>
            <p>
                Her true self emerges under the glow of the moon 
                <br>
                The subtle gleam of lunar beauty 
                <br>
                She is not worthy enough for the sun 
                <br>
                So she seeks comfort in the dead of night
                <br>
                As she reaches for the stars,
                <br>
                Her footsteps dance in sync with the wind 
                <br>
                Her spirit
                <br>
                Her grace
                <br>
                Her pained and aggrieved soul
                <br>
                She whispers secrets to the daisies as they fall asleep
                <br>
                All she ever wanted was to be heard
                <br>
                The moon holds her hand when she’s lost
                <br>
                And for a moment
                <br>
                This young girl is <em>holding the sky</em>
                <br>
                Together,
                <br>
                They are one
                <br>
                Together,
                <br>
                They are beautiful 
                <br>
                She is the moon’s girl

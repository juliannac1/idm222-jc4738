                Beginning of the End
            </h1>
            <p>
                <em>Why did you make me?</em>
                <br>
                <em>Why did you make me?</em>
                <br>
                I am built like twig I am not steel
                <br>
                I am not a brick of steel
                <br>
                I am not your girl.
                <br>
                Your one,
                <br>
                I am not your one.
                <br>
                My eyes are dilated and the pale under my skin is reaching for the surface 
                <br>
                Like a baby that’s been drowning too long and had her first breathe 
                <br>
                She reached the surface and she’s breathing now but I just look pale 
                <br>
                And dark 
                <br>
                And sad 
                <br>
                My eyes are black now and dilated, 
                <br>
                I just pulled my hair up, so hopefully I look better than I feel as I go outside 
                <br>
                On my fifth walk of the day searching for the door to my freedom
                <br>
                I walk towards the light because I think it’s leading me to Heaven 
                <br>
                Or a safe place 
                <br>
                A quiet place where I can breathe a little easier than usual and my eyes are the color of hazelnut, like they used to be
                <br>
                <em>It’s strange, isn’t it?</em>
                <br>
                Mistaking the sun for heaven
                <br>
                I like to go in front of the mirror and check if my heartbeat still looks like it’s beating and if my eyes look tired again today 
                <br>
                But once again it is and my eyes still look tired
                <br>
                And dilated
                <br>
                So I regret checking 
                <br>
                I laugh so hard when people see me cry and ask me if im doing fine. Not because it’s funny but because, well, it is funny actually. My chest is pounding and I’m holding my breath looking for a way out, but there’s nothing in my sight. 
                <br>
                I try and rub my key against my skin so it feels like I’m being cut and bled alive
                <br>
                Like I wish I was
                <br>
                <em>How did it happen again?</em>
                <br>
                <em>She killed herself?</em>
                <br>
                Oh
                <br>
                But the end of a life is not through death. it is not the end of their story. There’s a whole beginning.

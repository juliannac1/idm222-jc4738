                        Sometimes I feel like I can’t catch my breath and I’m spending the whole day just searching for my body’s rhythm. It seems I won’t catch up but my eyes are at the back of my head and I can’t see where I’m going either. I could be walking in a dark alleyway for hours and realize my destination is in the other direction. “Lost” is a layer of stone carved on my forehead, right next to the grave of a stranger I can’t quite remember the name of but she was a sweet girl. A kind, little, sweet girl. She was a body of gold with two gems around the sides of her eyes that glow when she smiles.
                        <br>
                        A beautiful stranger
                        <br>
                        A stranger I know everything about
                    </p>
                    
                </div>
                <div class="col-right">
                    <img src="" alt="">
                </div>
            </section>
        </div>
        <div class="container second">
            <section>
                <div>
                    <p></p>
                        <br>
                        My lips hurt from biting them so much and my scars are itchy again. I have more tears in my eyes than my body can release at a time. 
                        <br>
                        I have bruises for people to see so I can hide the bruises that they can’t. But <em>I</em> can see them. And I cannot seem to run away from them, actually, I even removed my eyes from my face and moved them to my spine.  It doesn’t matter the darkest alley I choose to walk through. I can force myself to not see or breathe, but I’ll still feel.
                        <br>
                        I will still breathe and my chest is still rising when I think it stopped long ago. My bruises began to crack the gold from my stranger and I eventually realized it’s fake after all this time. My tears dimmed the light off her gems. 
                        <br>
                        But it’s okay. 
                        <br>
                        It is okay because she is <em>my</em> stranger. She is mine. She’s <em>me</em>.
                        <br>
                        Can you hear me?
                        <br>
                        It is <em>okay</em>, because she is me.
